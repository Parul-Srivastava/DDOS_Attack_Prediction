# DDOS_Attack_Prediction
Predicting DDoS Attacks with Random Forest and KNN  and exploring the application of the Random Forest and KNN machine learning algorithms for predicting DDoS attacks.
üîç Project Overview: Predicting DDoS Attacks with Random Forest and KNN

We explored the application of the Random Forest and KNN machine learning algorithms for predicting DDoS attacks. Our methodology involved thorough data collection, preprocessing, and model training. We also employed feature selection techniques like ANOVA and interpretability tools like LIME to enhance the transparency of our model.

Research Focus: Unveiling the Best Traditional ML Algorithms
We explored a myriad of traditional ML algorithms, conducting in-depth research to identify the most effective ones for DDoS attack prediction. The journey involved studying the nuances of various models, but it was the detailed comparison that truly unveiled the strengths of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest.

üîó Why KNN and Random Forest?
After extensive research, we found that KNN and Random Forest stood out among the alternatives. Their robustness, accuracy, and adaptability in the context of DDoS attack prediction were unparalleled. The comparison between these two powerhouses sheds light on their unique capabilities, providing a comprehensive understanding of their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

üìä Key Findings and Conclusion:
-The Random Forest model and the KNN model proved to be powerful strategies for bolstering network security.
- The ensemble learning methodology reduced the risk of overfitting, providing transparency in the decision-making process.
- Feature importance analysis through Random Forest and ANOVA was crucial in identifying significant attributes influencing DDoS attack predictions.

üåê Impact and Future Work:
By adopting these comprehensive approaches, organizations can proactively defend their network infrastructure. The amalgamation of Random Forest, KNN, LIME, and ANOVA not only ensures prediction accuracy but also a deeper understanding of contributing factors. This proactive strategy safeguards online services, fortifying their digital presence in the face of evolving cybersecurity threats.
